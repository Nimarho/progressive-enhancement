            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                They said, <br>
                <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br> 
                The farmer said, <br>
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q><br>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><br>
                The farmer again said, <br> 
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q><br>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said, <br>
                <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">Bad</em></q><br>
                , and the farmer responded, <br>
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q><br>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said, <br>
                <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q><br>
                Again, he said, <br>
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q><br>
            </p>

                <blockquote>
                        <q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">Good</span> or <span class="bad">Bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">Good</span> fortune.</q>

            <p>
                <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">Good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">Good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
